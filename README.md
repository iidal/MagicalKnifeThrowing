# Magic Knives
This is a mobile game for Android built with Unity with the end goal of being published on Google Play store, giving me the opportunity to learn about that process.

The plot of the game is simple. An enemy throws magical orbs at the player, at an increasing speed, and the player must destroy them by tapping on a button corresponding the color and icon of the orb, which in turn throws a magical knife at the orb. If they fail to do this, the game is over. The player has the change to continue the game if they watch an ad (once those are implemented).
The player is not only equipped with the knives, but magical potions as well. With these potions they can slow down time and destroy multiple orbs at once, but only once during a game. Potions can be purchased from a little store with coins that are earned by playing the game.
